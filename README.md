# Athlete Linked List Data Structure in C++

## Description
This project implements a linked list data structure to manage a collection of athletes using C++. It provides functionality to store, manipulate, and retrieve athlete data efficiently. The linked list implementation allows dynamic addition and removal of athletes while maintaining a simple and flexible structure. This project can be useful in scenarios such as managing sports team rosters, tracking athlete statistics, or organizing event participants.

The project demonstrates key concepts in data structures such as linked lists, node manipulation, and dynamic memory allocation in C++. The code is designed to be compiled and run using Code::Blocks, making it easy to test and modify.

## Visuals
Since this is a console-based project, visuals could include screenshots of the console output during various operations like adding or removing athletes from the linked list.

Example:

```
Athlete List:
1. Name: John Doe, Sport: Soccer, Age: 25
2. Name: Jane Smith, Sport: Tennis, Age: 22
```

## Installation
To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure you have [Code::Blocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/) or another C++ IDE installed.
3. Open `main.cpp` in Code::Blocks.
4. Build and run the project.

## Usage
After building and running the project, you will be able to perform the following operations:

- Add a new athlete to the list.
- Display all athletes in the list.
- Remove an athlete by name or ID.
- Search for an athlete by name or ID.

Example:

```bash
# Adding an athlete
Enter Athlete's Name: Michael Jordan
Enter Sport: Basketball
Enter Age: 35
Athlete added successfully!

# Displaying all athletes
Athlete List:
1. Michael Jordan, Basketball, Age: 35
```

## Support
If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to open an issue on the repository or contact the author via email.

## Roadmap
Possible future features include:
- Sorting athletes by name, age, or sport.
- Implementing additional search options (e.g., filtering by sport).
- Adding file I/O functionality for saving/loading athlete data.
